                Methods of Note-Taking
            </h3>
            <p>
                No matter if you are at school, at university, at work or at home taking notes is part of our daily
                life. Especially to understand a complex topic, it's helpful to not just take notes but also structure
                them in a way so that the reviewing, understanding and rememebering a certain topic will be a lot easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are numbers of different ways to take notes and I'd like to present the most common methods:
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4>1. Outline/Outlining method:</h4>
            <p>
                Notes are organized in a structured form. Different topics and subtopics are organized by bullet points,
                dashes or numbers, that means in a form of an outline. It reduces the editing and reviewing time
                afterwards and the relationship between main topic and subtopics are identified quickly.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>2. Cornell method:</h4>
            <p>
                Notes are structured in two columns and one row below. The bigger right column contains the notes
                associated with the main topic and the smaller left column contains the keywords/questions/hints
                associated with the notes on the right. The row below summaries the collected notes. While taking notes
                use the right column and reviewing your notes in the left column.
                It's a simple and efficient method to take, review and summarize your notes in a systematic format.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>3. Boxing method:</h4>
            <p>
                All topics/pieces of information that are related to each other are grouped together in a box. The notes
                in each box can be organized/structured with another method like the outlining method for example.
                While taking digital notes e.g. on an iPad or another tablet the boxes can be reorganised, reordered and
                resized really easily and quickly.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>4. Charting method:</h4>
            <p>
                This method consists of a table of rows and columns. The main topic can be found in the top row and the
                subtopics/keywords/information are organized in the columns below. Each column categorizes a distinct
                topic of the main topic. It's a useful method to get an overview over a complex topic especially when a
                topic covers lots of facts and statistics.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>5. Mapping method/Mind mapping:</h4>
            <p>
                Notes are structured and organized in a visual way.
                The main topic stands in the middle or on top of the paper. Then the main topic is divided into
                subtopics around/below the main topic. The subtopics are also divided into branches and can be linked
                with each other depending on their relationship.
                Especially heavy content can be organized with this method in a simple and structured form.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>6. Sentence method:</h4>
            <p>
                Each topic is written in a whole sentence on a separate line. A visual aid, like highlighting the text
                with different colors, numbering each sentence and organizing main topics by using headings, can be
                helpful. With this method lots of details and information can be covered in a quick way.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                My favorites are 1, 5 and 6 (which I obviously use the most)!😉
            </p>
            <p>
                Which method of note-taking do you use or which do you like the most?

            </h3>
            <p>
                As you know from my introduction, I did an apprenticeship as a software developer and I’m currently
                studying Computer Science.<br>
                Programming is part of the curriculum but to be honest it’s just a small part.<br>
                Due to this and the fact that the programming languages, its libraries and frameworks develop very fast,
                it’s necessary to stay up to date, improve your knowledge and skills.
                <br>I’m a huge fan of (online) courses, tutorials and stuff to educate myself. Therefore I’d like to
                share some resources I used and think are useful during your studies.
            </p>

                I often get the question: „Hey I want to start coding but I don’t know where to start. Can you help me?“<br>
                In this blog post I want to share my thoughts on how and where to start programming, my experience
                and what helped me when I was in the same situation.
            </p>
            <p><strong>When to start?</strong></p>
            <p>
                Anytime and at any age.<br>
                Me for example: I started programming on a professional base at the age of 23 with a little html and css
                knowledge.
            </p>
            <p><strong>What to start?</strong></p>
            <p>
                There are many ways to start programming. It’s totally up to you and your interest.
                Not very helpful huh?
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Let me share my story with you:</strong></p>
            <p>
                During my apprenticeship, I had the opportunity to do both, backend and frontend development.<br>
                My apprenticeship was divided into 4 weeks of working at the company and 2 weeks of going to school. I
                learned C#, Java and SQL at school. At work, I was able to work with the frontend and backend team, so I
                learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery as well.<br>
                Over the last years I started to like web development and found my passion in that field.
                It turned out that this is my thing and this is what I want to do and what interests me the most.
            </p>
            <p><em>You need to try it out yourself!</em></p>

            <p><u><strong>Advice 1:</strong> Make a Checklist</u></p>
            <p>
                Take a paper, brain storm and write down what interests you the most!
                Are you into design, and like to create new and pretty content?
                Or do you like more the mathematical part? Are you interested in big data,
                data analysis, databases …?
                Do you want to develop games or apps for IOS and/or Android?
                And I didn’t even mention the systems and networks engineering...
            </p>
            <p><u><strong>Advice 2:</strong> Get started</u></p>
            <p>
                You can go the classical way and start an apprenticeship / internship / trainee program or study at a
                university. Take classes at something like adult evening classes.
                If you don’t have the opportunity or don’t want to go the classical way, you can do it on your own.
                Go to your local library and borrow some books and/or tech magazines.
                Or get started online. There are so many possibilities!
                Check tutorials on YouTube, read blogs, watch vlogs, listen to podcasts or choose an online course on an
                online learning platform.
                (I will share some resources in one of my next posts)
            </p>
            <p><u><strong>Advice 3:</strong> Join a community</u></p>
            <p>
                Either on social media platforms like Instagram (it’s a fantastic community with lots of amazing
                people), Twitter, Facebook, … <br>
                Or go to local coding meet ups, hackathons, conventions, or similar events. Just engage with other
                like-minded people.
            </p>
            <p><u><strong>Advice 4:</strong> Practice, practice, practice</u></p>
            <p>
                You won’t start programming and will learn and know everything within a short amount of time!
                Practicing is everything!
                In the end you have to the work, research on the Internet and collect your information and search for
                your solution on your own. It’s the best way to improve yourself. Of course you can ask for help but
                first try to solve it on your own. I can tell you, you’ll feel great in the end.
                Maybe you’ll fail in the beginning. It's not bad because we’ve all been there. But hold on and I can
                promise you it'll get better. It’s part of the progress.
                Start your own coding challenge like a 30 days or a 100 days challenge. It's up to you.
                Then program every day for about an hour or two for next x days.
            </p>
            <p>
                So when you ask me: what should I do? Backend, frontend, both/fullstack, database, app, … <br>
                It’s hard to say what you should do because what suits me maybe won’t suit you and vice versa.
