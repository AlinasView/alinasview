                        I love HTML, CSS, Javascript and Angular.</p>

                        You can find some resources that help me to improve my coding skills everyday like

                <p><strong>How did I get into tech?</strong></p>
                <p> I have always been interested with computers, video games and web design.<br>
                    The first time I got in touch with programming was on social media platforms like myspace and chat
                    rooms
                    where you were able to create individual pages with plain HTML and inline CSS styling.<br>
                    Although I chose another path after school and studied Event & Tourism Management. I found my way
                    (back) into the tech industry.<br>
                    After my studies I started new and began an internship and an apprenticeship afterwards in the IT
                    department of the company
                    I’m still working at.<br> During that time I also started to study Computer Science beside my daily
                    full-time job.
                    Like I mentioned before I started as a backend developer learning C# and Java.<br>
                    At the end of my apprenticeship I also had the chance to learn the basics of web development
                    including HTML, CSS and Javascript.<br>
                    At the beginning of this year I joined an Angular in five days course and I immediately fell in love
                    with it. </p>

                I often get the question: „Hey I want to start coding but I don’t know where to start. Can you help me?“
                In this blog post I want to share my thoughts on how and where to start programming, my and experience
                and what helped me when I was in the same situation.
            </p>
            <p><strong>When to start?</strong></p>
            <p>
                Anytime and at any age.
                Me for example: I started programming on a professional base at the age of 23 with a little html and css
                knowledge.
            </p>
            <p><strong>What to start?</strong></p>
            <p>
                There are many ways to start programming. It’s totally up to you and your interest.
                Not very helpful huh?
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Let me share my story with you:</strong></p>
            <p>
                During my apprenticeship, I had the opportunity to do both, backend and frontend development.<br>
                My apprenticeship was divided into 4 weeks of working at the company and 2 weeks of going to school. I
                learned C#, Java and SQL at school. At work, I was able to work with the frontend and backend team, so I
                learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery as well.<br>
                Over the last years I started to like web development and found my passion in that field.
                It turned out that this is my thing and this is what I want to do and what interests me the most.
            </p>
           <p><em>You need to try it out yourself!</em></p>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p><u><strong>Advice 1:</strong> Make a Checklist</u></p>
            <p>
                Take a paper, brain storm and write down what interests you the most!
                Are you into design, and like to create new and pretty content?
                Or do you like more the mathematical part and are less interested in design than rather in big data,
                data analysis, databases …?
                Do you want to develop games or apps for IOS and/or Android?
                And I didn’t even mention the systems and networks engineering.
            </p>
            <p><u><strong>Advice 2:</strong> Get started</u></p>
            <p>
                You can go the classical way and start an apprenticeship / internship / trainee program or study at a
                university. Take classes at something like adult evening classes.
                If you don’t have the opportunity or don’t want to go the classical way. You can do it on your own.
                Go to your local library and borrow some books and/or tech magazines.
                Or get started online. There are so many possibilities!
                Check tutorials on YouTube, read blogs, watch vlogs, listen to podcasts or choose an online course on an
                online learning platform.
                (I will share some resources in one of my next posts)
            </p>
            <p><u><strong>Advice 3:</strong> Join a community</u></p>
            <p>
                Either on social media platforms like Instagram (it’s a fantastic community with lots of amazing
                people), Twitter, Facebook, …
                Or go to local coding meet ups, hackathons, conventions, or similar events. Just engage with other
                like-minded people.
            </p>
            <p><u><strong>Advice 4:</strong> Practice, practice, practice</u></p>
            <p>
                You won’t start programming and will learn and know everything within a short amount of time!
                Practicing is everything!
                In the end you have to the work, research on the Internet and collect your information and search for
                your solution on your own. It’s the best way to improve yourself. Of course you can ask for help but
                first to try to solve it on your own. I can tell you, you’ll feel great in the end
                Maybe you’ll fail in the beginning. It is not bad because we’ve all been there. But hold on and I can
                promise you it will get better. Well it’s not bad, it’s part of the progress.
                Start your own coding challenge like a 30 days or a 100 days challenge. It is up to you.
                Then program every day for about an hour or two for next x days.
            </p>
            <p>
                So when you ask me: what should I do? Backend, frontend, both/fullstack, database, app, … <br>
                It’s hard to say what you should do because what suits me maybe won’t suit you and vice versa.
